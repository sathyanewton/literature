---------> Kural <---------------------

Thirukkural - Maxims for life. One a day # 975 -
Greatness is taking on rare endeavour;
And done only in the rightful manner.

திருக்குறள் # 975
பெருமை உடையவர் ஆற்றுவார் ஆற்றின்
அருமை உடைய செயல்.

The kural looks like a repeat of kural #26 which said that those who accomplish what is normally not accomplished by ordinary people are the ones who are considered great.

But Valluvar is not known to repeat a message. This kural (#975) talks not only about the great being those who take on things that others cannot normally do. It also talks about how they get them done. Being truly great is not about taking dishonorable means even for an end that is a truly noble goal.

The point of greatness lying in taking on difficult tasks having already been made earlier, the pivotal point of this kural is about the means to an end being honourable. The operative word of this kural is ‘aatRin’. ‘aaRu’ means ‘neRi’ which is the Tamil word for ‘manner’.

At the height of its popular mobilization, Mahatma Gandhi suspended the Non-Cooperation Movement in 1922 because a frenzied mob set fire to a police station in Chauri Chaura because the police killed three people after opening fire on picketers who were agitating to get the police to release those arrested while protesting in front of a liquor store. The fire resulted in the death of 23 policemen. Shocked at this turn of events, Gandhiji started a fast to atone and reflect on whether he had not prepared the people enough on Ahimsa or Non-Violence to practise restraint even in the face of violent attacks. Mahatma Gandhi received a lot of criticism for suspending the protest that had captured the imagination of the public at large across the country. A lesser politician would have viewed the incident as an opportunity to ratchet up the tension and create many more such incidents to attract international opprobrium for a regime that was taking violent police action to put down peaceful protestors.

Greatness is not taking shortcuts. Greatness is braving the long and difficult road to an honourable destination.

perumai udaiyavar aatRuvaar aatRin
arumai udaiya seyal.

GU Pope’s couplet
The man endowed with greatness true,
Rare deeds in perfect wise will do.

மு வ உரை
பெருமைப் பண்பு உடையவர், செய்வதற்கு அருமையான செயலைச், செய்வதற்கு உரிய நெறியில் செய்து முடிக்க, வல்லவர் 


Nerunal ulanoruvan inrillai ennum Perumai udaithuiv vulaku

The one, who was here yesterday, is no more today and That is a matter for great wonderment, in this world. A man is one day and is not the next; that is the special significance of life on earth. A man like young Emperor Alexander too, who conquered half the then known world, was just snuffed out of existence like the light of Othello's brief candle. One day he was the monarch of all the surveyed and the next day he was gone. That is why Thomas a - Kempis, who wrote that great devotional book 'Imitation of Christ' exclaimed 'So passes away the glory of the world'. Such is the special significance of life on earth, which Kambar referred to in his Classic thus: "Piranthaar paeyarun thanmai piraraal arindharkaelidho?"
